# Grokking Deep Learning

### Overview
Develop Deep Learning Models for Natural Language in Python

### Description
Grokking Deep Learning is desgined to help give you a foundation in deep learning so that
you can master a major deep learning framework. It begins by focusing on the basics of
neural networks and then switches its focus to provide an in-depth look at advanced layers
and architectures.

#### Pre-requisites
No knowledge of linear algebra, calculus, convex optimization, or even machine learning
is assumed. Everything from those subjects that’s necessary to understand deep learning
will be explained as we go. If you’ve passed high school mathematics and hacked around in
Python, you’re ready for this course.

### Labs
Labs for this course are available at path shared below. Elev8ed Notebooks (powered by Jupyter) will be accessible at the port given to you by your instructor.
